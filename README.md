## GTFS Ruby

A Ruby wrapper for the [General Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/)

## Getting started

Initialize a new GTFS source:

    # Defaults to strict checking of required columns
    source = GTFS::Source.build(<URI or Path to GTFS zip file>)

    # Relax the column checks, useful for sources that don't conform to standard
    source = GTFS::Source.build(<URI or Path to GTFS zip file>, {strict: false})

Accessing GTFS data from the source:

    source.agencies
    source.stops
    source.routes
    source.trips
    source.stop_times
    source.calendars
    source.calendar_dates     
    source.fare_attributes    
    source.fare_rules         
    source.shapes
    source.frequencies        
    source.transfers          

Alternatively:

    source.each_agency {|agency| puts agency}
    ...
    source.each_transfer {|transfer| puts transfer}

## Differences with nerdEd/gtfs

This fork extends [nerdEd/gtfs](https://github.com/nerdEd/gtfs) with a number
of additional features used by Transitland. In some ways, however, it is also
breaks compatibility; mainly, entity attribute names are now taken
directly from the GTFS spec without removing "prefixes", e.g. `stop.stop_timezone`
instead of `stop.timezone`
